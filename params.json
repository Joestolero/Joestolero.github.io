Also being in ROTC made me gain more confidence because I was sho shy before but when I became a part of ROTC, I noticed that I get more focused in school. \r\nWhen I first came here in the U.S, I was so shy to talk to the people except to my family because I did not know how to speak English and every time there is a person asked me questions, I would feel hot and nervous so what I do is, if I do not get the question, I just smile at them or just say yes or no. Then when I started going to school, I was taking CCE class and I was so happy because I thought the computer class in the U.S would be hard but it was not. The class was pretty basic; We just worked on how to use the Microsoft words, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, etc. But when it gets to presentation, That is what I do not like because I get really nervous also I was not fluent in speaking English.\r\nWhen I became a Sophomore, I took AOAME and again at first it was easy but when it got to the middle of the semester, it got harder and harder. Also I was going to take I.T in college but when we started doing codes and animations, that is where I changed my mind on taking I.T because it was so hard and frustrating and you must have a lot of patience when you are doing a project and you have to be very careful because I remember when I was doing my final project and when I was almost done, the software that i was using crashed and I forgot to save it so I was so mad but the good thing was my teacher gave me more time to redo the project and I learned that for every computer work you do, \"YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SAVE YOUR FILE OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MIND.\"\r\nA year passed and I became Junior, the hardest year I have ever had in my opinion and maybe to other people too because all of my subjects were hard and the teachers were strict. But that year was when I got to ROTC as my academy and it helped me a lot because the students or my classmates were told to help their classmates if they need help and I think that is how I managed to do my home works and projects because they were helping me. At first I thought ROTC would be like military because I see the students were standing straight when they are called in attention and their uniform but my thoughts were wrong because I think ROTC was the easiest subject I have ever had. They wear uniform, serious, and focused but ROTC always have fun and I would really recommend ROTC class to the other people.\r\n\r\n# **My Personal Logo**\r\n\r\n![Personal Logo] (https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12036578_1011661578855754_4427569163742672016_n.jpg?oh=05c6e94e701b519ae281e5868f8b482c&oe=57B21C9B)\r\n\r\n# **Games**\r\n[Click to play](http://www.freetetris.org/game.php)\r\n\r\n![](http://stagetetris.globalhost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Master_TetrisLogo_R_700x4562.png)\r\n\r\n[Click to play](http://totaljerkface.com/happy_wheels.tjf)\r\n\r\n![](http://happywheels2demo.net/logo.jpg)\r\n\r\n# **AOAME Presentations**\r\n\r\n### **Which Box**\r\nClick the Links Below:\r\n\r\n[Which Box](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GtJAm5NcDcZM3QN6KX9zNMESxmFjdupPOM1Imn7TMs0/edit#slide=id.p)\r\n\r\n[Marriage Equality](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U7aAkFV-fudfWvUY1GOyhVokcS18xznR3TlEYAzGXms/edit#slide=id.p)\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE:\r\n“It’s mine, this is my website!
